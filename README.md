# CMPM35-FinalProject

-- By Daniel Aughenbaugh --

Character controller with idle, walking, running, and dance flair animations. Features smooth transitions between animations. Background utilizes the threejs cubemap texture support.

Model and animations from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).

Cubemap from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping#/media/File:Panorama_cube_map.png) (this was the only Creative Commons cubemap I could find, and the borders aren't perfect as I cropped them from the full image).

Code based on [this threejs example](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/webgl_loader_md2_control.html).

Controls: WASD to walk. Hold shift to run. Press space to do a dance flair. Default threejs orbit camera controls.
